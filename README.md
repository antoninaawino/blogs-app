# blog-website

I managed to create a fully functional blog website using django
I used crispy forms, bootstrap 4.0.0, mysqlite3 and django
Creating an account uses signals.py to initialize and create a profile for you.
I used gmail as my email serverto reset passwords
Used paginator to paginate the website and load five posts per page
Users have full control of their accounts. They can create, update or delete their own posts.
The users can also edit their profile and there is a default image being used when they create their accounts and they can change that later to whatever they would feel comfortable with.
The admin page is also fully functional definitely.
I have a base.html inherited by home.html and main.html inherited by the other web pages too.
